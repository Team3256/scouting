- Emotions: the whole scouting app (both WarriorHappy and WarriorSad, and more :wink:)
- Event: An FRC event such as CalGames 2023 or Silicon Valley Regional 2024
- Match: A singular match of 2 alliances pitted against each other in an event
- Alliance: red or blue, consisting of 3 teams
- Playoff alliance with backup: 4 FRC teams, 3 of which plays in a match (e.g. elimination matches)
- Playoff alliance: the 3 FRC teams that play in a match
- Team: an FRC team (e.g. 1678, 3256, or 254)
